For non-beer experts, a pale lager is a type of beer that was originated in Europe. Its taste has a mild bitter essence with a slight sweet malt aftertaste. Buckler was introduced in 1988 by the makers of Heineken. 		What drew me to Buckler was the label's close resemblance to Heineken's and the decal designs on the bottle reminded me of German ales. The non-alcoholic label is embedded into the Buckler symbol. Buckler's overall appearance is very appealing to a person who either does not want to be depicted as a non-alcoholic drinker or likes imported beers. 		Buckler's taste defiantly mirrors its Heineken counterpart. It's slightly bitter with a sweet malt aftertaste, which means Buckler is a true non-alcoholic pale lager. The downside of the taste is it does mimic most non-alcoholic beer with a flat watery taste. But, the beer pours a nice golden brown color smoothly into a mug. Also, an inch of initial head is present but quickly disappears like a normal pale lager.		Although Buckler isn't the strongest tasting non-alcoholic beer I've encountered, but if you're a pale lager or Heineken fan, I would strongly recommend Buckler for you.

The pour yields about 1 fingers worth of head in a relatively well carbonated beer. At such a low gravity, the malt content is fairly simply and light, and that lends to the color of the beer, a light clean straw colored hue. The head retention is fleeting, though in a beer with such low alcohol, there were likely not enough proteins produced to form, much less retain, a stellar head.		The aroma is light and refreshing with a touch of grassy and floral hop character. Not bitter at all, as there seem to be only aroma hops in there. The flavor is similar, as floral and light grassy touches complement a light and sweet grainy flavor.		Thin on the palate, but disappointingly slightly under carbonated, this beer is certainly a great refreshing brew to enjoy on a hot day.

The flavor delivers the expected maltiness of a non-alcohol beer, but it's very nicely balanced by a lemony/grassy and floral hoppiness. If I had to guess, I'd say that the alcohol is removed by heating the finished beer given that it offers a lighter than usual level of maltiness; the burnished look of the body; and a dose of cardboard-like oxidation in the finish. That said, I find a slight defect in the oxidation, but that's a trade-off as I think I prefer it to the very malty NA's that use ""dumb"" yeast instead.

These will be my first low alcohol beers and I'm interested to see how beer of this style tastes as well as how these two Germans stack up against one another. I wonder if the green-bottled Clausthaler will suffer in comparison with the brown-bottled Warsteiner. I'm also intrigued that both breweries mention their beer's adherence to the Reinheitsgebot, or German purity law.		Pale amber, nowhere near straw colored. It's noticeably lighter than the Clausthaler, but is on par with most light beers or pale lagers, and is darker than some. The head is a slightly paler shade of eggshell and is nearly the equivalent of its competitor in terms of structure, persistence and lace. A half point less impressive perhaps.		The nose isn't quite what it could be. Grain is the obvious focal point, but it smells stale and musty compared to the Clausthaler. It's a dead ringer for a lesser quality Euro pale lager, while being relatively free of any truly offensive aromas.		If Clausthaler was bad, this one is worse (although it did hold up much better with warming and was actually better by the bottom of the glasses). On the positive side of the ledger, it's less strongly flavored, which makes it less offensive than it otherwise might be. It also strikes me as a very poor imitation of beer, and in fact, is barely recognizable as such. None of the usual rules apply, so I'm having difficulty coming up with beer-like descriptors to convey the flavor. 'Bad' and 'not much' will have to suffice.		The finish is mineral-like and slightly sour, and the mouthfeel is as light and as flat as it is on the other beer. There's no clear winner in the body/mouthfeel category, but there is a clear loser. Me.		Warsteiner Premium Fresh (I find it interesting that both beers use the word 'premium') is an unpalatable, nearly undrinkable, beverage.

When doing these head-to-heads, I try to maintain some sort of theme rather than throwing two completely unrelated beers into the ring. 'Germany's finest' seems as good a theme as any, although I'll see in just a few minutes how fine the beer really is. One thing is certain, at least I'll be clear-eyed and clear-brained throughout.		The beer is a much darker and richer amber than the St. Pauli; not that remarkable since the other beer was acid-washed straw in color. The foam is also a few shades darker, more ivory than glaring white. Consistency-wise, the head looks just as good, persists just as long and lays down just as much lace. A pleasantly surprising look to both beers, but now the real competition begins...		See the St. Pauli review for a description of the nose, but the short answer is 'nasty'. I keep going back and forth between the two glasses trying to pick up the slightest difference between them, but haven't managed to do so. For all intents and purposes, they smell identical. And identically bad.		Compared to its competitor, Beck's Alkoholfrei is Westvleteren 12. Not really, but it is noticeably superior even if it's still pretty crapalicious. I don't experience quite the same level of revulsion when the liquid hits my tastebuds, though they still shrink in horror at what I've subjected them too. Even though a higher taste score will likely carry this beer to victory, it's still lousy.		Like the flavor, the mouthfeel is nothing to write home about, but it shines in comparison to St. Pauli's mouthfeel. At least there's a little (very little) volume and smoothness. Neither beer's carbonation is notable; they're neither under- nor over-bubbled.		I haven't yet put in the numbers, but it's obvious that Beck's Alkoholfrei/Non-Alcoholic is the better of these two products and is, therefore, the winner of the first NA Shootout (With Blanks).

M: Light, soft, and lively. Perhaps a bit too bubbly, but it's never prickly in the least. Quite pleasant.		O: I really thought I would hate this beer, and I don't. It's bland and forgettable, but I wouldn't expect anything else from the style. It tastes just like a generic Euro lager, and a better-brewed one than many. I'm actually quite impressed, even though I have absolutely no desire ever to drink it again.		Cheers!",woosterbill,3.5,Male,"Aug 22, 1984",462006000.0,956329447.0

Before I could ask the obvious question, she pointed out that it was Czech low alcohol beer, and that it was pretty good. Since all I've ever seen for this kind of 'beer', is the usual O'Douls in Safeway, she pointed me to the local Italian grocery store. I was curious, so the next time as I was getting my fix of carne e formaggi, I noticed quite the selection of NA beers. No Czech offerings at that time unfortunately, but a slew of German ones, and for $1.50 a pop (no pun intended), I thought what the hell...		This beer pours a crystal-clear pale straw colour, with lots and lots of puffy white head, that melts away quickly, leaving decent webbed lace around the glass.

The taste is a bit drier than I expected from the nose, but still has a sweet, unfermented maltiness to it that was in the nose. With the ample carbonation it almost pulls of a certain dryness. The sweetness reminds me of apple juice at times. When I add the sediment the beer becomes cloudy and perhaps a touch less sweet. Towards the finish a dry, almost husky, slightly toasted grain note slips in. While, this is not really a great substitute for beer, it is better than some German malzbiers that I have had.

I'm beginning to think that it's impossible to brew a good, flavorful, low alcohol beer. I've always wondered why brewers who decide to tackle this style don't brew something other than pale lagers and the occasional amber lager.

There's no banana (0.0/5.0 on my hefe weizen banan-o-meter) and no clove. How is it possible to brew such an un-hefe-like hefe? I know that alcohol is an integral component of beer, but I never dreamed that removing it would make such a difference.		The mouthfeel isn't half bad, considering. It's light-medium and wheaty smooth with much less carbonation than I had feared. What does it matter when the vehicle is carrying such lousy cargo?		Erdinger Weissbier Alkoholfrei is not a good low alcohol beer. Needless to say, it doesn't even deserve to be mentioned in the same breath with a real hefe weizen.

It's oddly reminiscent of an American extra pale ale, like Full Sail. Cookie dough lingers on the tongue. Winter spices are here also, weird but not in a bad way. I've noticed in NA beers a certain bread-staleness which is normally masked or preserved in regular beer by the alcohol. Here it is not too intrusive. It's a tasty beer, with a full if not sensuous mouthfeel, and good drinkability. It is, surprisingly, closer to my dreamed-of NA bitter than I would have expected.",Thrasher,3.5,,,,

So, as I prepare to drink and review my first one, the option of reviewing it *as* a low alcohol beer (in other words, in comparison with others of the style) isn't an option. Reviewing it as beer doesn't seem fair either. Therefore, I have decided to review two such offerings in a comparison tasting. By reviewing the current #3 (this one) side-by-side with the current #21 (Warsteiner Premium Fresh), I hope to find out what makes a beer of this style good, or at least palatable. Enough introductory nonsense, on with the show...		Lucent golden amber that appears darker than most light beers and is several shades darker than its competitor. The head is a fine thing indeed; eggshell in color with plenty of stickiness and a characterful texture that would make beer of any style proud. There's quite a bit of chunky lace on the glass that looks as if it won't be washed away easily. This one has nothing to be ashamed about so far.		Clausthaler Premium has the clear advantage when it comes to the nose. There's a pleasant, bright, fresh grain, citrusy aroma emanating from the glass that trounces anything currently being brewed by the Big 3 and most Euro pale lagers. This really is high-quality stuff, alcohol or not.		Taste is where these two really suffer. This one looks and smells good, but that's where the party ends. Maybe alcohol really does make an important (critical it seems) contribution to the flavor of any given beer. It's hard to put into words, but it tastes fake, as if the brewers tried to pass it off as beer without using any of the usual ingredients. There's very little grain flavor and the bright, slightly citric, character of the aroma is long gone.		The finish is a little vegetal and lingers longer than I would like. The body is light beer light and the mouthfeel matches the flavor in being overly flat. Clausthaler Premium needs something badly and that something is alcohol. But then it would cease being what it is and what's the point in that? Well...		If this is the #3 low alcohol beer on the planet then this is a style that has a looong way to go.

A- Slightly lighter and redder than Coke, but pretty similar looking overall except for the thin tan head that lingers.	S- Sickly sweet; Grapenuts was the first thing that popped into my head; grainy; almost a farm-like scent, but I think that's just the grain smell.	T- For anybody who's ever brewed, it tastes like carbonated wort. For those who haven't, it's cloyingly sweet. The taste of cane and brown sugar hits your palate immediately. Nothing really complex, just sweet malt with a touch (and I mean just a touch) of hops in the finish.	M- On the thin side for a beer; typical of a cola.	D- I think I should be drinking this ice cold, which I'm not. As it is, I can't imagining finishing this 0.5L bottle.		Overall: I suppose it's worth trying as a curiosity if you've never had the style before. To that extent, I don't regret buying the bottle.

Of course, if it had more bitterness and maybe some roasted flavors, it might be a little more interesting. As such, I'm not entirely ready to condemn the idea of Malzbier.		On a side note, Malzbier is now being marketed as an energy drink. The bottle reads: ""Erfrischender Malzdrink: more taste, more fun, more energy.""

S: honeyish malts, with rich grainy touches of corn-cake, and a restrained fruitiness of banana and some herbal hops. Overall, simplistic, and slightly too sweet for a Klsch.

To put it bluntly, Malta was the worst beer or beer-like product I have ever tried, and I once ran afoul of a Milwaukee's Best Light!

The best thing about Malta is its smell, which reminded me of a mocha cappuccino that you might get from Seattle's Best coffee or a second-rate Starbuck's. Malta starts exactly like heavily sweetened and lightly creamed coffee. It tastes (not surprisingly) like coffee and chocolate, thought neither is very pleasing. I thought it had no beer-like flavor or texture at all. Malta is nonetheless full-bodied, and its finish is creamy and a litle like a soft drink.

For my research purposes, I would like to critique Sharp's as its own entity because it does not share the name of any Miller products. And because of this, Sharp's does not represent American Lagers, not to mention, N.A. beers, with deference.		As stated from the last article, American Lagers are beers made with rice and corn and are primarily found in North America. Popular American Lagers are Miller Light and Bud Light. 		Just like Busch N.A., Sharp's has the initial appearance of an authentic American Lager, until it settles into the glass. The head quickly disappears to leave a slight white coating that bears a resemblance to scum on a pond. When the carbonation bubbles disappear, an almost clear blonde body appears. 		Sharp's smell is of a sweet and bitter mixture. Hints of hops and barely are also present in the smell. The taste also has a bitter sweet sensation with a dry and flat aftertaste. Personally, Sharp's is the only macro-brew American Lager that has a sweet flavor and aroma, which makes Sharp's not authentic to it's alcoholic parallels. 		Maybe Miller decided a bitter sweet essence would set a part Sharp's from other American Lagers, but for the purposes of assimilating a non alcoholic beer into the mainstream the beer needs to resemble a familiar beer flavor for beer drinkers to respond positively.

Shootout (With Blanks) IV will be a contest between this English entry and Buckler, the pride of Holland. Or, if you prefer, between the breweries themselves, Guinness Ltd. and Heineken Brouwerijen. Which one of these giants can brew the most palatable low alcohol beer? If the first three contests in the series were any indication, it'll come down to which one is the least offensive.		I don't believe I've ever seen such a stark difference in color between two beers in any of my head-to-head matchups. Kaliber is pale orange and Buckler is sun-bleached straw. I wouldn't be surprised to learn that Guinness uses caramel coloring. The heads are both more than respectable. This one is off-white and the other is bright white. Since I have no preference regarding the colors, the appearance scores should be the same.		Kaliber's nose is the weaker of the two and smells quite a bit less like beer. There's no real offensiveness since there isn't much present to offend. Even though I'm going to give the edge to its competitor, I appreciate the fact that I can venture near this glass as many times as I want without experiencing that typical N.A. nastiness.		The difference on the palate is even more pronounced. The flavor tastes fake to me. I know that malt extract is occasionally used in home brewing and that I probably couldn't tell the difference between it and all-grain in the hands of someone who knows what he's doing. So instead of malt extract, let's just say that Kaliber tastes like beer made with beer extract. Not good.		There isn't much difference in the mouthfeels since both are lighter than light.

Ingredients list corn syrup, caramel colour, and sulphite in addition to the usual water, barley, hops, yeast, and hop extract.		PC Blonde Brew is pale straw in colour, just as it's name suggests. Visibly active carbonation feeds a fizzy white head that takes about 15-20 seconds to disappear, leaving a surprising lace behind. I would think this was a pils, euro lager, or decent American macro if it were poured from an unmarked container.		Smells mildly grainy; furtively, transiently floral. Very very faint, but still at least slightly beer-ish. The taste could also be described as beerish, having a slightly sweet and mild cereal character finishing with a mild bitterness. Has a bit of medicinal quality to it in the aftertaste. Inoffensive if you don't let it warm up.		Thin and watery with a prickly carbonation. Refreshing and quenching when cold. Definately not for the beer geeks, but does a good job of imitating the mass market domestic lagers and old man trying to limit his consumption grew up drinking.",mintjellie,2.5,,,,

Calling this beer straw-colored does a disservice to straw; it's one of the palest beers that I've ever poured. It's clearly unfiltered with a modest amount of superfine 'stuff' floating within.

As a beer lover in general, I was surprised N.A. beer still has the realistic taste of ""authentic"" beer but no ability to make one act drunk and foolish. My current mission is to taste test all of the N.A. beer I can get my hands on and critique each for authenticity, color, clarity, and awesomeness.		 		The first beer on my safe and sober journey is Busch NA. For starters, Busch NA is brewed by Anheuser-Busch in St. Louis, Mo. Its famous alcoholic counterparts are Busch and Busch Light which were introduced into the mainstream market in 1979. All are considered American Lager beers. American Lager is a common light beer made with primarily rice and corn and is usually brewed in North America. Examples of famous American Lager beer are, Coors, Miller Light, and Bud Light.		 		Busch N.A. has common physical similarities to genuine American Lagers such as Old Style, Blatz, and of course, Busch Light. Once poured and settled into a glass, Busch N.A. looks like champaign, as light bubbles float to the surface. Also, a small white head a half of finger in width gravitates to the top of the glass. When comparing Busch N.A. primarily on physical appearance I have to conclude it mirrors its alcoholic equivalents superbly.		 		Surprisingly, the taste of Busch N.A. also closely resembles the authenticity of an American Lager. The main quality of an American Lager is a light-flavored taste. All American Lagers have this quality but every beer is different; hence the reason for different variations of American Lagers on the market. Unlike most American Lager N.A. beers, Busch N.A., has a very distinct bitter taste often associated in alcoholic equivalents Old Style and Pabst Blue Ribbon. Instead of criticizing Anheuser-Busch for that, I praise them for taking a beer that is meant to resemble a bitter, light-flavored American Lager and present it in a non-alcoholic version.		 		The only downfall to Busch N.A. is the outer appearance. At first glance, the can resembles its alcoholic equivalent. So if your goal is to be an undetected responsible drinker, this would be a good choice. The only downfall is a fairly large NA stamp on the front, but a grip around the lettering can easily solve this problem.		I give Busch N.A. an B+ for awesomeness! If your beers of preference are American Lagers with a hint of bitterness then try a safe alternative, Busch N.A. The makers of Busch N.A. have truly created an excellent non alcoholic beer which does not hide the American Lager authentic taste.",feroc34,3.0,,,,

The damn things have been sitting there for over a month and I've become curious. Blasted!		A pristinely clear beer. Bubbles wondering about. A light straw yellow colour. An ideal creamy, half-finger level of bleach white head that looks ... a little 'too' perfect. In fact, the whole beer looks, well, ideal. A little 'too' ideal ... I'm suspicious, but impressed, but suspicious... I don't trust it. 		Mmmmm, malty corn. If you've ever not rinsed out your cans and left them by the sink, or in the garage, and found them weeks later... or perhaps you've had a barbecue, and people leave half drank bottles in the sun... 		I'm forced to use these comparisons because the smell is, honestly, kinda hard to describe. All these beers I've tried I have yet to develop a nose for chemicals... it's bad, nay, it's terrible. That said, this is no different from the stink, the staleness, the adjuncts, and the repulsion of other macros...		The mouthfeel flirts dangerously close to water if not for a stale, bready taste. The beer is quite heavy on the palate, making it fairly refreshing. 		Like the bitterness, flavour is practically non-existent less maybe some stale corn and chemical-like adjuncts. There is an odd, strong metallic aftertaste. It leaves the palate to feel polluted and sullied. 		I didn't want to drink this to begin with, but I can assure you any optimism was severed by the stench of the aroma. An appropriate stench that warns of the vile horrors to come! Ok... it's not 'that' bad but I refuse to put any more of this in my body. 		If anything, the non-alcoholic aspect helps its case. Surprisingly, this never became outright offensive. It can easily pass for a drinkable beer, especially to those who don't normally drink. In fact, I'd prefer this to Bud Llight, or Coors Light.

M: Thin and watered down feeling, seems like this was run through a strainer several times over to produce a blander, weakened essence of an Amber.

The immediate impression is with how thin and weak flavored this feels and tastes. It is well carbonated, very sprite and as a result can be called a refreshing drink perhaps, but the flavor implied by the aroma is quickly lost in a peppery and watery drink that has a metallic overtone It's very thin and just a hint of some wheat here.

It was very carbonated. On the first sip the beer tasted like (surprise) caramel. There was a ittle edge of hops and maybe some dry bitterness like seltzer. There was an aftertaste that tasted like (surprise again) caramel. Toward the end, the aftertaste drifted a little toward sourness. This was not a bad sourness but was a little odd.

Taste, as with any N/A beer, is going to suffer, but this still has a lot going for it. Unlike many N/As, this is relatively dry, with a clean lager snap from the yeast, with a touch of malty, grainy tannin to let you know, that, yes, this is beer, made from grain. Deceivingly beer-like. The score is low, yes, but this was far better than expected.		Mouthfeel is spot-on, crisp and clean, never overwhelming. If there's one thing that Anheuser-Busch does extremely well, it's mouthfeel. Well done here.		Drinkability....well, we were debating how many it would take to get you drunk (there is some alcohol in here, after all), but, before that, I think that only a few of these would get to be too much for the palate. Put it this way -- I ended up drinking two of these, and one regular O'Doul over the time we spent at the bar. If we had stayed for another round, I would have easily gone for another Amber.		All in all, no, this isn't on par with many beers out there, but for an N/A brew, it's hard to go wrong with this.

O'Doul's Amber is actually rustic orange with tangerine edges. It's much darker and richer looking than its competitor, but then that was by design. Although there are many more visible bubbles in this beer, the head doesn't look nearly as good. It's beige in color and is soft and frothy rather than bubbly and sticky. Soap sudsy lace makes a brief appearance on the glass.		The aroma is remarkably low on power. A hint of minimally toasted grain greets my nose... and not much else. While there's nothing much here to like, it's vastly superior to the olfactory mess coming from the German NA. Definite edge to the American.		It's obvious that Anheuser-Busch has decided that the best way to get people to drink NA beer, a historically bad tasting style, is to eliminate virtually all traces of flavor. Michelob Ultra has more flavor than this stuff. Interestingly, a faint burst of sweet, faintly caramel-like malt becomes apparent on the finish. I say 'interestingly' because the finish is preceded by absolutely no flavor whatsoever.		No surprise that the mouthfeel is on the light side. It earns some measure of respect though by failing to descend into wateriness and by having a 'just right' amount of carbonation. Another winning category for the stateside beer.		O'Doul's Amber wins NA Shootout (With Blanks) II by a mile and wins it, essentially, by default.

Will it be a titanic struggle reminiscent of WW II or will it be a pathetic bout between two scared little girls? I'm betting on the latter, but let's see how things shake out.		Pale amber. The colors are virtually identical, with this beer perhaps being a quarter shade lighter when held up to my sunlit front window.

The very fact that there's almost none of the nastiness that is rampant in the noses of most low alcohol beer is a major victory. A clear win for the Yank.		O'Doul's might just be the best NA beer that I've ever had. It doesn't taste anything at all like good beer, but it does taste like what I expected good beer of this style to taste like. I've been disappointed that none, until now, have measured up. To be short and to the point, it tastes like barley flavored water. Again, to some that might be a ghastly sounding description, but with little or no alcohol involved, nothing better than that will ever be possible.		The mouthfeels are both light and borderline watery. The only difference is in the amount of carbonation. Despite the fact that this beer had more visible carbonation right after the pour, it's more subdued in the mouth at this point in time. I'm thinking identical scores here. 		I don't know whether it'll be reflected in the score of not, but I think that O'Doul's is the best low alcohol beer that I've ever had. It's certainly the least offensive, and that's all that really matters when it comes to the impossible task of brewing good beer while leaving out one of its essential ingredients.

Once more, Geronimo! Here we go! Look out below!		From the bottle: ""O'Doul's starts as a fine premium beer, full brewed, fully fermented and cold-aged. Using only the finest natural ingredients, O'Doul's delivers all the great taste of a fine premium beer."" 		This is how I amuse myself in the slow moments. It is probably a good thing for society that I am usually kept busy. My pour created better than a finger of bone-white head with moderate retention. Color was a light golden-yellow with NE-quality clarity. Nose reminded me of so many AALs that I have reviewed that I wondered which ""finest natural ingredients"" were used. At least no unnatural ingredients, like plastic (right, Minhas or should I say, the Cybermen Brewery) were harmed in the making of this brew. Mouthfeel was thin, not quite watery, but mot by much. It had a wheat-y, corn-y cereal taste in the mouth to the point that I thought it might have been liquid Chex Mix. Oh man, this was so boring that it could have put Muzak to sleep. Finish woke me up to tell me that it was leaving. What a snoozefest!

A- Pours a very light straw yellow color. One finger white head shows medium retention leaving a small collar on the beer itself. Very light streaks of lace on the sides of the glass.		S- Sweet bready malts and cereal grain. Not much else really going on here that I can tell. It's not really appealing to me although I didn't expect it to be. 		T- Sweet bready malts in the front of this clashes with a cereal corn off flavor. Alcohol like flavor comes in but it also coats the tongue in a weird flavor I can't place my finger on. Light hop flavor on the backend with a hint of metallic tinge toward the final ending. 		M- Light mouthfeel. Carbonation is good for the style I suppose. Sweet malts and cereal grain left on the palate. Aftertaste is mostly sweet hints of malts and alcohol (which there is so little) along with cereal grains. Light drying on the palate but it's not from the alcohol. Metallic off flavors which are common in a lot of BMC products I know. Flavors are balanced for the style. 		D- This beer is not bad for what it is suppose to be. My palate though after first sip started to feel this weird numbing feeling which is why I rated it as low as I did.

As a non-alcoholic beer, I suppose O'Douls accomplishes its job adequately: it tastes like a mass-produced lager. Is it good though?		O'Doul's pours a translucent golden yellow with a finger and a half of foam, which thins out a little but overall lasts for about 2 to 3 minutes. Aroma is somewhat skunky, perhaps due to the green bottle. Skunk aroma is mixed adjuncty grains and straw-like scents. On the palette, the beer feels like a standard macro-lager with a high-moderate amount of carbonation. As mentioned, it does taste like beer. The flavor is grainy with some wet paper flavors. There is an extremely light hop flavor, but make no mistake there really isn't any hop ""zing"" to this. The aftertaste is seltzer-y with some lingering graininess, and of course a beer like this finishes with no alcoholic warmth.		I asked before: is it good? My answer: not really. While it tastes like beer, that's because it SHOULD. After all why try marketing a beer substitute if it isn't going to resemble the real thing.

We're waiting for him to spit it out, you know, since it tastes so hideously unlike beer. But he doesn't. He keeps sipping it. Eventually we get a little anxious and ask him doesn't the beer taste crappy and he says, no, actually, it's not great but it's pretty good.		And you know something? He was right. This might be Anheuser's best-tasting regular offering. It doesn't pour that great, but it smells like a crisp European pils hopped at medium strength. No adjunct nastiness at all. Tastes about on a par with their discontinued World Lager--kinda like Stella only with a less bitter malt profile. There is a certain emptiness on the backend, where the booziness should be, but it's not nearly as pronounced as I had anticipated. 		Yes, it doesn't get you drunk. But aside from that there's absolutely nothing wrong with it. I guess this whole time I *have* actually been drinking beer mostly because it tastes good!",mynie,4.0,Male,,,

The body/mouthfeel is really no different on this beer in terms of heft (if that word is even appropriate to describe something so incredibly light in the mouth). Where it loses ground is in terms of carbonation. There's very little here and it gives the beer an insipid feel that does the ghastly flavor no favors.

How will the Teutonic Giant fare against the Behemoth from St. Louis? Let's find out.		Pale amber as well, although a wee bit darker than its competitor. Unless a light source is available, there's no way they could be distinguished from one another. The head is more ivory than white and is more bubbly than the O'Doul's. It has better persistence and leaves much more lace. Bitburger takes an early lead...		... that is just as quickly loses after the sniff test. While it isn't 'turn away in disgust' horrible, the nose is less appealing on this beer. It smells more metallic than grain-like. I've smelled much worse, but that doesn't mean that I should cut this one any slack.		Drive is the clear loser when it comes to flavor and will, therefore, handily lose the overall contest. It tastes more like beer than O'Doul's, mostly because it's actually bitter, but the bitterness doesn't seem hop-related. In addition, that nasty, clay-like 'NA funk' is present and ruins what might have been a decent beverage. It's far from the worst of the style though.		What would a low alcohol beer be without a light, insipid feeling mouthfeel? It's amazing what alcohol adds to beer; even mouthfeel apparently. Drive is a fraction more bubbly as I drink, but I can't say that I like it more as a result.		Bitburger Drive traded wins on appearance and smell and managed to stay at least even on mouthfeel. Unfortunately, it lost the all-important flavor comparison and is therefore the loser of NA Shootout (With Blanks) III.

Black, deep black with a medium tan head that very quickly turns to a tiny island lace with moderate glass ring.	Oh so very sweet...had to gargle with salt water to minamize the damage.	Label says manfactured by Stroh's Canada under the direct supervision of Banks(Barbados)Breweries Ltd.	Ingredients listed as water, malt extract, sugar salt and hops.	Wondering what kind of hops??????",Shiloh,2.0,,,,

Nose shows lots of malt with honey, caramel and butterscotch quite noticeable. Hops are not forgotten, grassy and spicy notes are prominent.

It is pale, with a small whitish head. Smells of, believe it or not, alcohol, despite having close to none. And that is it.	Taste is difficult to describe, but it is like getting a Bud Light and adding some water - you did not think it was possible, right:?	Mouthfeel is the same as water, and as for drinkability, I prefer a diet pepsi.	Absolutely horrendous. I have trouble calling this a beer.",brdc,1.0,Male,,,
